FILES:

    test01.in 

    File with DIMACS encoded maximum flow problem from http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/DIMACS_maxf.htm

    test02.in 

    Same file as test01.in, but without comment lines and modified 4 6 and 5 6 edges to 4 5 and 5 1. 
    This makes target node 6 (sink) unreachable, but that is allowed under DIMACS format defined 
    in above mentioned link.

    test03.in
    test04.in
    test05.in

    More maximum flow problems in DICAM format. Test 03 is from FIT BUT Graph Algorithm course presentation.
    Tests 04 and 05 are from https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/maximum-flow/tutorial/.

TESTS:

    test01_all.out

    command: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -v -f ./test/test01.in`
    Description: Demonstration of all flags working.

    test01_stdin.out

    command: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -v -f  < ./test/test01.in`
    Description: Demonstration of use of standard input for input.

    test01_i.out
    test01_v.out
    test01_f.out
    
    command: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i ./test/test01.in`
             `$ ./ford-fulkerson -v ./test/test01.in`
             `$ ./ford-fulkerson -f ./test/test01.in`
    Description: Demonstration of all flags working individually.

    test01_order.out

    command: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -f ./test/test01.in -v -i`
    Description: Demonstration of arbitrary random order of arguments, if 
                 conditions mentioned in README.md are satisfied.
    
    test01_badFlag.out

    command: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -a ./test/test01.in`
    Description: Demonstration of incorrect flag error. 
                 "-" prefix makes bash ignore error and continue executing tests.
    
    test02.out

    command: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -v -f ./test/test02.in`
    Description: Demonstration of program capability to handle
                 networks with unreachable target node (sink).

    test03_all.out
    test04_all.out
    test05_all.out

    commands: `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -v -f ./test/test03.in`
              `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -v -f ./test/test04.in`
              `$ ./ford-fulkerson -i -v -f ./test/test05.in`
    Description: Demonstration of algorithm and all flags working 
                 correctly on different maximum flow problems.
                 Original comment lines are lost, and "-i" flag
                 output has inserted standard DICAM format comments.
